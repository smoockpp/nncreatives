    "description": "In this project you'll build an online portfolio to showcase the work you've created as part of this program and any projects you've built on your own. This is your chance to show the world (and potential employers) the work you've done. In fact, the portfolio site itself is a great way to show what you can do. Bring all of your talents with HTML, CSS and JavaScript together to create a fun and interactive online portfolio. You'll host the portfolio site on the web either using a traditional web hosting company, or using free GitHub Pages hosting. We aren't supplying any files for this project: what it looks like and how it works is up to you. You can use a framework like Twitter Bootstrap or Zurb Foundation, or simply build the HTML and CSS from scratch. The design is up to you, but see the Resources section for our courses on using frameworks and example portfolio sites you can use for inspiration.",

    "description": "Web site performance is often a live-or-die metric for web sites and apps. Sites and apps that load, or appear to load, quickly are usually seen as being better built and more useful. Also, taking people's available bandwidth, especially on mobile devices, into account makes people happier about using your site or app. Apply the skills you've learned for optimization of graphics, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to take a poorly optimized page and reduce the total load size to under 1.3MB. You will need to analyze the assets you've been provided to see where optimizations can and need to be made, make those optimizations, and measure their success. Multiple analyzation, optimization, and measuring cycles may be required.",

You can build utilities, games, infographics, and more. You can also integrate, display, and analyze social media and large data sets without having to create and curate them yourself. Use at least 1 of the supplied APIs to grab data from at least 6 items from that API. For example, 6 books on Open Library, or 6 movies from the Open Movie Database. Display these items on a page in an attractive gallery of images or titles. Clicking the image or title, opens a lightbox just as in the Interactive Lightbox project earlier with detailed information about the item.",

These web applications, often include pages for looking at your profile, what you've done in the week or what you need to get done. These 'dashboards' act like your control panel for controlling the web app. In this project, you'll take a mockup and a few icons and build a beautiful, web dashboard complete with JavaScript-driven charts and graphs. You only need to take the design and create the HTML, CSS and JavaScript functionality for this one page -- you don't need to create other pages, or build any backend or database functionality.",
